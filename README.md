Rock, Paper, Scissors...will you be the next Champion?

This was a project that I was nervous of undertaking at first but I had a lot of fun as I coded the console version and the now finished version with UI.
Finished first version in January 19 2022 

In this project: 
(1) I implemented game logic in JavaScript for the first time
(2) Interacted with the DOM, manipulating CSS classes with JavaScript
(3) Imported font icons for the first time

This project is the first significant milestones for me although it is quite simple. Praise Lord Jesus!
